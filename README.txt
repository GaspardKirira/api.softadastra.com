🛠️ Prerequisites
CMake ≥ 3.14

A C++17 compatible compiler (g++, clang++)

OpenSSL

SQLite3

MySQL C++ Connector

Git

On Ubuntu/Debian:

bash
Copier
Modifier
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev libmysqlcppconn-dev
⚙️ Compilation (build)

Go to the c++/ folder:

bash
Copier
Modifier
cd c++
Create a build/ folder and generate with CMake:

bash
Copier
Modifier
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -DENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON -DBUILD_TESTS=ON
make -j$(nproc)
🚀 Run the backend
Once compiled, you will find the executable in:

bash
Copier
Modifier
./build/bin/Softadastra
🧪 Run the tests
Unit and functional tests are integrated with GoogleTest:

bash
Copier
Modifier
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
